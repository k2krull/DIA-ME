# Increasing Proteomic Depth of Single-Cell Analysis by Enhanced Feature Matching
This repository contains processed files, including protein and peptide tables, of searches conducted in the DIA-ME preprint (biorxiv.org/)
The work comprises four data sets that can be found on PRIDE with the following extension numbers: ... .

# Project description
In this work, we present and evaluate the DIA-ME workflow for the proteomic analysis of scarce samples down to single cells. 
MEs (matching enhancer) are samples of higher peptide amount from the same sample origin that are co-analyzed with a set of low-input samples to facilitate matching of pepitde identifications.
